## SidSync - A Markdown Based Notes Syncronisation, Publication and Management System

### Why?

First off, this project was created for two main reasons:

1. As part of the creator's self-improvement plan to grow skills in the areas of DevOps, Microservices, full-stack application creation and **deployment**. This is due to a career pivot the creator made in 2023 from IT Support type roles to Platform Engineering. While the creator is not a Software Engineer, and as such some of the skills needed to deliver this project will be out of scope of their job requirements, they endevour to try to keep to best practices in all areas of the project implementation both out of personal interest and broadening the scope of their professional understanding.
2. As part of the creator's personal need for a better system to manage their knowledgebase type notes, which they use Obsidian for but without the premium subscription. 

### What?

With the two core contextual purposes behind the project in mind, the idea of the project is to deliver a Microservice architecture solution to provide at minimum the following functionality:

- [ ] Syncronisation of local markdown files contained within a folder (vault in Obsidian terms) to a remote server.
- [ ] Backup / built in redundancy of said MD files
- [ ] Conversion between different higher order syntax flavours of markdown such as Obsidian, Hugo, other notetaking applications supporting MD as content storage format.
- [ ] Conversion of selected directories to html via hugo static site generation.
- [ ] Publication / syncronisation of website content (generated by hugo) to web hosting services via common protocols.
- [ ] Basic user based management such as sharing pages, directories etc between users, adding users to joint projects etc.
- [ ] Basic version history but explicitely not version control, we are not reinventing git - if you need version control, use a version control system instead.
